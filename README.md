## Hex number in 8bit length

Although this is not ultrasonic, but I assign the following frequencies to each hexa-decimal number of 8 bit data length:

|Hz   |Hex|
|-----|---|
|18500| 0 |
|18600| 1 |
|18700| 2 |
|18800| 3 |
|18900| 4 |
|19000| 5 |
|19100| 6 |
|19200| 7 |
|19300| 8 |
|19400| 9 |
|19500| A |
|19600| B |
|19700| C |
|19800| D |
|19900| E |
|20000| F |
